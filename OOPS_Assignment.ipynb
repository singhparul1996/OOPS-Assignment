        "Here's a more detailed explanation of key concepts:\n",
        "Core Principles of OOP in Python:\n",
        "**Classes:**\n",
        "Think of a class as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (attributes and methods) of the objects that will be created from it.\n",
        "**Objects:**\n",
        "Objects are instances of a class, meaning they are concrete realizations of the class's blueprint. They hold their own data and can perform actions defined in the class.\n",
        "**Encapsulation:**\n",
        "This principle bundles data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a class. It protects data from direct external access and modification, promoting code organization and preventing unwanted changes.\n",
        "**Inheritance:**\n",
        "Allows a class (a subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (a superclass or parent class), promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.\n",
        "**Polymorphism:**\n",
        "Enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, allowing for flexible and reusable code. It means the same method name can have different behaviors depending on the object it's called on.\n",
        "Abstraction:\n",
        "Focuses on the essential characteristics of an object and hides the unnecessary implementation details, simplifying interactions."

By implementing dunder methods, you can customize the behavior of your objects and make them work seamlessly with Python’s language constructs.\n",

        "__init__(self, ...): This is the constructor method that gets called when an object is created from a class. It initializes the object's attributes and performs any necessary setup.\n",

        "__repr__(self): This method returns a string that represents the object in a way that can be used to recreate the object. It is invoked by the built-in repr() function and is typically used for debugging purposes.\n",
        "__len__(self): This method returns the length of an object and is invoked by the built-in len() function. It is commonly used for sequences like lists, tuples, or strings.\n",
        "__getitem__(self, key): This method enables object indexing and slicing. It allows you to access elements of an object using square brackets ([]).\n",
        "__setitem__(self, key, value): This method enables object assignment with indexing. It allows you to set values for elements of an object using square brackets ([]).\n",
        "__delitem__(self, key): This method allows you to delete elements from an object using the del statement and square brackets ([]).\n",
        "__eq__(self, other): This method compares two objects for equality using the == operator. It returns True if the objects are equal and False otherwise.\n",
        "__lt__(self, other), __gt__(self, other), __le__(self, other), __ge__(self, other): These methods define comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=) for objects. They allow you to perform object comparisons based on custom criteria.\n",
        "__add__(self, other): This method allows objects to be added using the + operator. It defines the behavior of the addition operation for objects.\n",

When a method in a subclass has the same name, the same parameters or signature, and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.\n",

If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed. In other words, it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.\n",

        "  -Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility by allowing different objects to implement the same method in unique ways while sharing a common interface, simplifying complex programs.\n",
        "Here's a more detailed explanation of why polymorphism is important in OOP:\n",
        "1. Code Reusability & Flexibility:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes as objects of a common type, enabling you to write generic code that can handle various object types without modification.\n",

        "2. Extensibility and Maintainability:\n",
        "When new subclasses are added, you don't have to modify the existing code that uses the base class interface because the new subclasses can inherit and implement the base class methods in their own way.\n",
        "This makes your code more adaptable and easier to maintain as the application evolves.\n",
        "3. Simplified Code Design:\n",
        "Instead of managing multiple special cases, you can focus on the parent class or interface, simplifying code structure and reducing potential errors.\n",
        "It allows you to design and implement more robust and maintainable systems.\n",
